# REFlEx
REFlEx (Rapid Estimation of FLood EXtent) is the geomorphologic inundation model developed at CIMA Foundation

### Intallation
Prerequisites:
- Grass Gis v.7.* with addons: r.stream.basin - r.stream.order - r.accumulate
- [Compatible gdal and proj libreries](https://github.com/c-hydro/fp-system-library)
- [Python3 reflex virtual environment](https://github.com/c-hydro/reflex/tree/main/install)

WARNING! The version of the gdal python package should match the one installed on the system, before to install replace in the "fp_python3_reflex_libraries.yaml" file the version of gdal (gdal=2.3.3) with the one obtained from the command "gdal-config --version"
